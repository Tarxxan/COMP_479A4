day cost this event is free organization school of graduate studies contact daniela ferrer where online calendar submit an event latest news when studying for doctoral degree phd candidates submit thesis that provides critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student own contributions to the subject the distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is significant and original contribution to knowledge once accepted the candidate presents the thesis orally this oral exam is open to the public abstract in analog beamforming abf the digital phase shifters dpss and digital attenuators das are expensive and devices the amount of insertion loss and costs can be substantially increased with respect to frequency and number of bits used which is tricky for beamforming the main problem stems from the limited number of bits of the dpss contributing to periodic error which yields harmonic distortion in the beamspace domain called quantization lobs qls however such limitation can also incur gain loss and beam point deviation the periodicity of error can be trivially interrupted by inserting portion of noise an independent random signal with specific distribution before the quantizer called dithering likewise discretized antennas such as reflectarray ra and transmitarray ta antennas suffer from phase quantization this problem even escalates at higher frequency bands as the physical pixel size gets scaled down hence it may fail to provide enough phase states for the case of digital beamforming dbf the number of bits used to quantify the data and the complex beamforming weights has profound impact on the computational burdens and the system performance for the case of large aperture multiple independent beams and high data rate large number of bits might be impossible to use which can lead to the distortion problem somehow the same as one happens in the analog counterpart we adopted the approach for and synthesis for the first time to do that and and digital finite impulse response fir filters are designed based on the discrete hilbert transform method in particular the digital filter design for synthesis is comprehensively investigated respecting the error spectra in the beamspace domain it is shown for the first time that by pushing the error out of the visible region the decrease of antenna directivity due to the quantization can be compensated to some extent which provides an advantage over the uniform distribution of error in some cases pushing the error out of the visible region might be impossible for such cases we proposed using the filter moreover it has been shown that the method is of maximum efficacy when both the phase and amplitude of the excitation signal are controllable thus noise shaping can be exploited for the synthesis of the phased array showing quite promising performance furthermore the superiority of noise shaping over conventional random methods for null restoration is brought to attention with several examples for the first time it is shown that the conventional dithering approaches are ineffective for restoring the null embedded in the antenna radiation pattern to cancel the interference since random dither typically contributes to flat noise that fills up the nulls thus those approaches that contribute to uniform error can not be used for this purpose however the noise shaping approach which is spectrally shaped dither can conveniently address such an issue also the method is implemented at the layer specifically in one array architecture all are assumed with the same complex weights in an overlapping configuration the set of first layer outputs is introduced to digital platform or further tiled to third layer and so on here concept study based on the noise shaping approach addressing the quantization error at the layer is presented for the first time the noise shaping might be used for the last layer since it typically has enough elements in this case the noise shaping is exploited to push the distortion to where other layers factors have enough attenuation which is supposed to alleviate the ql level to some extent to do that novel approach is proposed in which the factor or composite factor should be tiled with the periodicity of the array factor and subsequently contribution of all tiles yields the digital filter layout evidently the antenna is of synthesis as the magnitude of the aperture field is imposed by the feed therefore one may use noise shaping to address the quantization issue one should note that the aperture efficiency drops in many applications due to beam shape loss in contour beams and antenna in this regard other error types including fabrication quantization should be managed to keep the antenna performance acceptable specifically one method to generate multiple simultaneous beams is to use feed chain in front of reflector that might be designed to compromise the extreme beams performances we have presented novel multi objective optimization based on pareto dominance for the design of ra also we have investigated the quantization issue incurred by the practical pixel this has been treated by using signal statistics and the noise shaping approach which is used for antennas for the first time this method can mitigate the quantization issue due to practical pixel response nevertheless it is shown that the local periodicity assumption is an important limitation since increasing the depth of the stopband filter for noise shaping inserts considerable portion of noise into the phase arrangement on the reflective surface which is problematic for antenna performance also the filter stopband should be designed for all extreme beams limiting effectiveness for mechanical steering then resonant type element based on the delay line is chosen for better control of phase delay arrangement two prototypes are fabricated one based on conventional design and the other based on spectrally shaped noise the performance of the two antennas compared with each other it is concluded that the noise shaping can somewhat relax the ra
