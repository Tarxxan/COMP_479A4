organization school of graduate studies contact daniela ferrer where online calendar submit an event latest news when studying for doctoral degree phd candidates submit thesis that provides critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student own contributions to the subject the distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is significant and original contribution to knowledge once accepted the candidate presents the thesis orally this oral exam is open to the public abstract separation technologies as versatile platforms have attracted considerable attention for water recycling and reuse due to their ease of operation high separation efficiency excellent sustainability relatively low energy consumption and industrial viability among them composite tfc membranes have been widely employed for the desalination of seawater and separation of small organic compounds however the polyamide tfc membranes still suffer from the severe fouling and limited water permeability which are mainly ascribed to their intrinsic surface hydrophobicity and uncontrollable interfacial polymerization process to address the current challenges and limitations in tfc membranes it is essential to develop new methodologies and design new functional materials for the fabrication of tfc membranes in this research new strategy based on the bioinspired chemistry has been explored for the fabrication of tfc membranes in the strategy cellulose nanocrystals cncs with substantial quinonoid active sties have been prepared through oxidative of dopamine which enable the subsequent crosslinking with polyethylenimine pei electrospun nanofiber mats enms produced from electrospinning has been employed as the supporting layer in order to enhance the membrane permeability tfc membranes are fabricated with the modified cncs as the active layer via facile vacuum filtration on enms followed by further with pei the achieved ultrahigh pure water permeability pwp superior dye rejection and remarkable salt permeation demonstrate its great potential for the effective separation of mixtures and recovery of these valuable components to expand the application of bioinspired chemistry in tfc membranes rapid of dopamine with zwitterions via covalent polymerization triggered by has been further proposed to construct the thin film selective layer the fabricated tfc membranes with the incorporated zwitterionic structure from show enhanced surface hydrophilicity and superior performance towards both typical hydrophobic contaminants proteins and organic molecules organic dyes in addition to the development of new strategies new diamine monomer featured with trimethylamine tmao structure methylamine dnmao has been designed for the fabrication of polyamide tfc membranes via interfacial polymerization its charged group is directly connected without extra atoms and has the typical characteristics of zwitterions the fabricated tfc membranes show high water permeability high selectivity and improved antifouling ability apart from the polyamide tfc membranes zwitterionic polyester tfc membranes have been also fabricated via interfacial polymerization in this research endows typical sulfonbetaine sb zwitterionic structure which is one of the most widely used zwitterions in the fabrication of membranes the performance of the polyester tfc membranes has been systematically investigated on the purification of and wastewaters the results in this thesis demonstrate the promising application of bioinspired chemistry in the fabrication of tfc membranes for the treatment of organic wastewaters meanwhile the new generation of zwitterions based on structure shows great potential for the modification of the conventional polyamide tfc membranes to alleviate fouling propensity furthermore this research also highlights the promising application of polyhydroxyl monomers in the fabrication of polyester tfc membranes to enhance
