the past present and future in our ongoing relationships with indigenous and other peoples within the montreal community pronunciation wahéhshon shiann whitebean has prepared comprehensive resource that provides thorough explanations of the history of the territorial acknowledgement the rationale behind the specific wording and responses to number of frequently asked questions about the acknowledgement history rationale convocation faq videos history throughout our history concordia has sustained relationships with indigenous peoples and communities on the island of tiohtià ke or montréal and its surrounding area the concordia indigenous directions leadership group is currently developing history section on the indigenous directions hub to depict and celebrate many of the occasions and collaborations that we have shared the following is brief history and explanation of the territorial acknowledgment upon which we hope to build the concordia community has developed many versions of territorial acknowledgements practices and gestures that continue to foster meaningful and respectful relationships with indigenous community members knowledge keepers and collaborative partners the territorial acknowledgement that we are practicing today is grounded in that history many members of concordia staff faculty students and community partners have made contribution to the discussion wording and rationale behind it our acknowledgement is built from cumulative efforts of many minds from diverse backgrounds and we hope to keep an dialogue with all of our stakeholders rationale how and why we worded the acknowledgement this way line by line this specific version of the territorial acknowledgement was primarily authored by wahéhshon shiann whitebean and karl hele with significant contributions at the final stages from louellyn white the final draft was agreed upon unanimously and passed by the indigenous directions leadership group on february would like to begin by acknowledging that concordia university is located on unceded indigenous we debated and discussed variations of this statement that included naming number of first nations and indigenous communities that are rooted in the island of montréal and surrounding area many first peoples claim the land and waterways as homeland traditional territory or birthplace of their people since time immemorial this includes but may not be limited to the kanien kehá ka mohawk of the haudenosaunee confederacy abenaki and anishinaabeg algonquin it is not our role to offer determination of claim instead we offer recognition and support of all indigenous peoples and nations who have and continue to make these lands and waters their homes we kept the word unceded since there are no agreements or treaties that have transferred title from any indigenous nation to settler ownership or control the land was occupied without permission this also demonstrates that we recognize the injustices that are part of the colonial history of this place and that concordia boldly supports and stands in solidarity with the indigenous members of our community the kanien kehá ka nation are recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today many indigenous peoples communities and nations helped to build the foundation of tiohtià ke however it is understood and widely supported that the kanien kehá ka have strong historic and ongoing presence in the territory with two communities bordering montréal kahnawà ke and kanehsatá ke this is also in consideration of the oral of the island that the kanien kehá ka nation has passed from generation to generation we must recognize the role of the kanien kehá ka in protecting and caring for the lands and waters that we share and enjoy today their stewardship is model for how we must collectively respect our natural environment and community as whole tiohtià ke commonly known as montréal is historically known as gathering place for many first nations the historic and current presence of two kanien kehá ka communities is acknowledged by the use of the place name tiohtià ke an abbreviation of teionihtiohtià kon which loosely translates as where the group it is here where the group ways that formed natural stopping point for first nations travellers thus the region since time immemorial has served as gathering place which marked the area key site of diplomacy as well as for the exchange of culture language and goods it is this centrality and importance of the region that drew the first settlers to the island the importance of tiohtià ke for first nations and settlers was demonstrated in when great peace was negotiated and signed thereby ending series of destructive wars among various first nations today it is home to diverse population of indigenous and other peoples it is important to include our vibrant urban indigenous community as well as the many peoples from diverse backgrounds that now reside here we respect the continued connections with the past present and future in our ongoing relationships with indigenous and other peoples within the montréal community this is similar to gathering of the minds we are weaving together the past present and future of the entire montréal community that is built on an indigenous foundation this is reminder to anyone that is not indigenous to this place that the enabled us to be here that indigenous peoples and communities are still present and vital to our prosperity and that we all must be engaged and invested in our collective future to move forward together convocation graduation ceremonies spring convocation ceremonies in included territorial acknowledgement at the start of the proceedings stated publicly by lead member of concordia administration the indigenous directions leadership group will continue to work with the convocation planning committees and concordia administration to modify and adapt future convocation ceremonies in way that includes and supports indigenous identities cultures and languages our goal is to develop an inclusive and open environment for all concordia students staff faculty and community members concordia also supports the choice of any indigenous peoples to wear dress at convocation ceremonies in addition to or as an alternative to formal academic attire frequently asked questions when and where to deliver the territorial acknowledgement why does concordia have territorial acknowledgement concordia is committed to fostering positive and mutually respectful relationships with local indigenous peoples and communities many of whom are students staff and faculty members territorial acknowledgement is means of recognizing that indigenous peoples have long history with the land and waters that we gather upon today and that this is their home and territory this creates space for dialogue community building and exchange in the true spirit of tiohtià by drawing on its history as place of diversity diplomacy and economic significance this is also way that we embrace our role within the territory to ensure the prosperity of our diverse community and the longevity of the lands and waters for future generations can the acknowledgement be aloud typically the acknowledgment would be stated at the beginning of any event meeting or gathering happening at concordia or sponsored by the university within the territory the objective of stating it at the beginning of an event is to situate the events and its participants it also serves as means of reaffirming the type of relationships that we as an institution collective or individual are establishing with the place and caretakers of the lands and waters therefore the intention set in the territorial acknowledgement should be stated consciously in an effort to foster positive relationships with indigenous peoples across canada similar territorial acknowledgement should be stated elsewhere when visiting the territory of another this gesture respects local indigenous peoples and communities outside of concordia and the montréal region when hosting or participating in events within other territories simply put an acknowledgement of people territory or space should not be limited to the concordia campus or montréal area when is it appropriate to give territorial acknowledgement it is always appropriate to deliver territorial acknowledgement however there are times when it is not necessary for example in regularly scheduled team meetings an acknowledgement is necessary during special occasions events activities and meetings where opening remarks or speech will be delivered in front of an audience it is also good practice to deliver an acknowledgement in high level meetings that only occur few times per year will indigenous people at the meeting be insulted if territorial acknowledgement is not delivered no we understand that sometimes people forget or that they are unsure whether they should have we understand that it learning process and that it will take time before the delivery of territorial acknowledgement becomes second nature we are more likely to be frustrated if the territorial agreement is delivered carelessly read word per word and treated as mandatory and meaningless recitation before the real business starts the meeting started and no one delivered territorial acknowledgement feel it should have been done can spontaneously give an acknowledgement yes everyone is at liberty to do so it is not the sole responsibility of the chair to ensure that an acknowledgement is made the respectful way to proceed in such circumstances is to ask the chair if you can do so is it appropriate for me to give brief territorial acknowledgement if someone has already done it officially this is important to me go for it can the territorial acknowledgement be added to publication materials websites or syllabus absolutely the territorial acknowledgement is good starting point for deeper conversations about our relationships with the caretakers of the lands and waters on which we are situated it is appropriate to open these discussions in class or in any event as pedagogical opportunity to learn about history culture politics and think critically about our institutional and personal relation with tiohtià ke and the diverse peoples who live here today please see below for how to cite the territorial acknowledgement who to acknowledge am not sure on whose ancestral lands am how do find out if you are close to college or university it is useful to consult their websites to find out and to get sense of their territorial acknowledgments alternatively caut has published guide many larger cities also have adopted territorial acknowledgements you can consult the website of the city you reside in or that is closest to you if you live close to an indigenous community or communities this may also help you determine whose traditional territories you are on however it is necessary to verify the information since many indigenous peoples have been displaced and the territory they find themselves on today may not be their ancestral lands plus some territories intersect or were and are still used by multitude of indigenous peoples as gathering places am joining meeting virtually and am not on the same territory as concordia should acknowledge the territory where am physically yes the territory you physically occupy takes precedence but it concordia meeting shouldn acknowledge the ancestral lands on which concordia is built yes you can acknowledge the territory you find yourself on as well as the territory that concordia is built on an easy way to get around this conundrum is to establish in advance who will deliver the acknowledgement for concordia all other participants are then free to acknowledge the other territories they are joining from it is important to note that you can deliver your own territorial acknowledgement even if you find yourself on the same territory as concordia or another participant at the meeting can am afraid to mispronounce kanienkehà ka and tiohtià can just use the word indigenous or mohawk instead no it is important to mention the specific peoples concerned all of canada is indigenous land it is also important to welcome and adopt the terminology that indigenous peoples use to designate themselves words such as mohawk and cree were often attributed by other indigenous nations or by europeans settlers often with negative connotations don hesitate to ask for help if you do not know how to pronounce indigenous words to learn the proper pronunciation of kanienkehà ka and tiohtià ke listen to the audio clips on this page why can use the word mohawk don the words mohawk and kanienkehà ka refer to the same people the words mohawk and kanienkehà ka do refer to the same people however many first nations are reclaiming their national and cultural identities by getting rid of the colonial terminology used to designate them terminology that was not in use prior to european contact confused in kahnawà ke many of their organizations still use the word mohawk like the mohawk council of kahnawà ke why can use it the decolonization of terminology is lengthy process that often has legal implications official band and reserve names are still often imposed by the federal government it is up to the community to decide which names to use in specific contexts in the context of the territorial acknowledgement concordia has chosen to honour the term that the people of tiohtià ke use to refer to themselves how to deliver the territorial acknowledgement who can aloud the acknowledgement territorial acknowledgement can be read by anyone it does not have to be an indigenous person the acknowledgement is particularly designed to assist people that do not identify as indigenous to situate themselves within an indigenous it is also designed to remind people of deeper history that is often forgotten or neglected there are indigenous people at the meeting wouldn it just be easier to ask one of them to deliver the territorial acknowledgment it is disrespectful to ask indigenous people attending the meeting to deliver territorial acknowledgement especially if this is their land the acknowledgement should always be delivered by persons who are guests on the land an indigenous person who is guest in tiohtià ke can deliver the acknowledgement but it is important not to single out the only indigenous person in the meeting and expect them to deliver the acknowledgement how does the indigenous directions leadership council deliver territorial acknowledgement in meeting amongst themselves person is usually designated in advance this person can never be someone who originates from the ancestral lands we are gathering on all other meeting participants are free to deliver short personal acknowledgement of their own don want to read the official text word per word it long and feels impersonal can just deliver territorial acknowledgement without reading this text the best way to deliver territorial acknowledgement is to be familiar with the text and give heartfelt acknowledgement in your own words it is also important to infuse something more personal for example thanking the concerned indigenous people for the opportunity to live work and play on their ancestral lands or speaking of why it is important to you to acknowledge the land you find yourself on the text is an official document reserved for written communications and formal affairs in other situations it serves as guide why does everyone look so serious and somber when they deliver territorial acknowledgement it is either personal choice or desire not to offend delivering territorial acknowledgement is serious business but it is not intended to be delivered like funeral address indigenous cultures are meant to be celebrated it is perfectly fine to deliver an acknowledgement in more upbeat manner if group or department already has territorial acknowledgment do have to replace it with this one of course not there are many acceptable ways to acknowledge the territory and local indigenous peoples and communities as our knowledge experience and relationships develop and change so will our ways of acknowledging and collaborating within tiohtià indigenous community we have also developed few principles to help guide the process of practicing or developing territorial acknowledgement as starting point below other questions what the difference between territorial acknowledgement and an opening or welcoming by an indigenous elder knowledge keeper or community member indigenous peoples and communities have diverse ways of knowing and cultural protocols that guide how they acknowledge each other and recognize the territory they are visiting or residing within being indigenous to broad area such as turtle island north america is not the same as being part of specific community nation or territory that has ancestral roots and relationship to particular place welcoming or opening may happen in variety of ways here are some examples indigenous visitors when visiting the traditional territory of another indigenous community nation or people an indigenous person may draw on their own cultural knowledge and protocols to acknowledge the local indigenous community to the best of their ability they may refer to the relationship or history between the two communities or their personal experiences by making an of tobacco medicines food seeds personal belongings words songs opening ohèn ton karihwatéhkwen that come before all else this is sometimes referred to as thanksgiving address or gathering of the it is the formal way that kanien kehá ka people of the flint mohawk open and begin all types of gatherings the words and the length of the address vary according to the speaker it is typically done in kanien kéha mohawk language and may or may not include tobacco burning what is more appropriate for gathering at concordia an opening or territorial acknowledgement can we do both yes you can do both however the preference of an member that has agreed to open an event takes precedence ask them how they prefer to be introduced and if they are comfortable with territorial acknowledgement being part of their introduction or the opening if the event includes indigenous peoples from many territories the representative from the local indigenous territory takes precedence respect how they wish to proceed if at any point you feel you must choose between an opening or territorial acknowledgement go with an opening as it has more significance to the territory and to the community we have developed comprehensive guidelines explaining the appropriate protocols to follow when working with indigenous elders knowledge keepers and community members how do cite this territorial acknowledgement in recognition of the work that was done by members of the indigenous directions leadership group in creating this territorial acknowledgement it is recommended to cite it as follows
